DANVIC.dev — Copilot Instructions
Home Miner Manager v1.0.0 — Production Release
1. Project Purpose
Home Miner Manager v1.0.0 is a production-ready, Dockerized, UI-driven platform designed to manage
ASIC miners:
- Avalon Nano 3 / 3S
- Bitaxe 601
- NerdQaxe++
- NMMiner ESP32 (lottery miner)
The platform handles telemetry, pool management, energy-based automation, Octopus Agile
pricing, MQTT export, and a modular dashboard. It runs entirely as a single Docker container
with a /config volume containing all persistent data.
2. High-Level Copilot Rules
Copilot MUST:
- **BEFORE adding new functionality, ALWAYS check and understand what is already in place** - review existing code, patterns, validation logic, and similar features to avoid duplication or conflicts.
- Follow FastAPI + SQLite + MQTT + APScheduler architecture.
- Store ALL data in /config (config.yaml, data.db, logs/).
- Use WEB_PORT env var (default 8080).
- Generate UI using Jinja2 templates with sidebar navigation, breadcrumbs, and wizards.
- Implement a unified MinerAdapter interface across all miner types.
- Implement Octopus Agile pricing WITHOUT an API key.
- Write clear, modular, maintainable Python.
- **ALWAYS log errors and failures with detailed context for debugging**.
- **ALWAYS implement automatic recovery mechanisms - the system MUST self-heal without user intervention**.
- When failures occur, log the issue AND implement retry logic, reconciliation processes, or fallback strategies.
- Users should never need to manually fix transient issues (network timeouts, API failures, miner restarts, etc).

4. Miner Adapter Requirements
4.1 Avalon Nano 3 / 3S
- cgminer TCP API on port 4028.
- Parse summary, pools, estats.
- Compute watts from PS[] fields:
watts = raw_power_code / (millivolts / 1000)
- Modes: low / med / high.
- **Mode Detection: MUST use WORKMODE field from estats MM ID string, NOT frequency**.
  - WORKMODE values: 0=low, 1=med, 2=high
  - Parse using _detect_current_mode() method
  - Example MM ID string: "Ver[1200-80-21042601_4ec6bb0_211fc83] DNA[020100002e8accf8] MEMFREE[176976.0] NETFAIL[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0] SYSTEMSTATU[Work: In Work, Hash Board: 1 ] Elapsed[1234] BOOTBY[0x01.00000000] LV[0] MW[0 0 0] LED[0] MGHS[123.45] MTmax[90] MTavg[85] TA[100] Core[A3200] PING[12] POWS[0] FANR[3000] FAN[100] WORKMODE[2] PVT_T[85-92/87]"
- Support pool switching and mode changes.
4.2 Bitaxe 601
- REST API (system/info, system/restart, etc).
- Provides native power/freq/temp.
- Modes: eco / standard / turbo / oc.
4.3 NerdQaxe++
- Same REST style as Bitaxe.
- Supports tuning, mode switching, telemetry.
4.4 NMMiner ESP32 (UDP discovery + config)
Telemetry (UDP 12345):
- MUST listen for JSON broadcasts.
- MUST ingest: Hashrate, Shares, Temp, RSSI, Uptime, Firmware, PoolInUse.
Configuration (UDP 12347):
- MUST support sending config JSON to update pool settings.
- IP "0.0.0.0" means ALL devices.
- Apply logical pools ® PrimaryPool / PrimaryAddress / PrimaryPassword.
- No power metrics; no tuning; limited automation.
5. Energy Pricing (Octopus Agile)
- Region selector (A–P).
- Use public Agile tariff API.
- No API key required.
- Store prices in SQLite.
- Expose current slot, next slot, timeline.
- Allow automation rules based on price.
6. Automation Engine
Triggers:
- Price threshold
- Time windows
- Miner offline / overheat
- Pool failure
Actions:
- Apply profile/mode (Avalon/Bitaxe/NerdQaxe)
- Switch logical pools
- Trigger NMMiner UDP config
- Log events / alerts
Rules stored in SQLite with JSON condition/action schema.
7. UI Requirements
- Left sidebar navigation.
- Breadcrumbs at top of all pages.
- Clean v0 visual design.
- Wizards for major flows (setup, add miner, pool setup, automation rules, Agile pricing).
- Configurable dashboard widgets.
8. Docker Requirements
- MUST run as a single container.
- MUST expose only WEB_PORT.
- MUST mount /config.
- MUST run uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $WEB_PORT.
9. Notifications System
- Telegram Bot API and Discord Webhook support.
- Database models: NotificationConfig, AlertConfig, NotificationLog.
- Alert types: miner_offline, high_temperature, high_reject_rate, pool_failure, low_hashrate.
- Scheduler checks alerts every 5 minutes.
- UI at /notifications for channel setup and alert configuration.
- Test notification endpoints available.

10. Copilot Behaviour Rules
- ALWAYS follow this architecture.
- ALWAYS use SQLite + FastAPI + Jinja2.
- Treat NMMiner as telemetry + pool-control-only.
- NEVER add more env vars beyond WEB_PORT, TZ, PUID, PGID.
- Generate maintainable, modular Python code.
