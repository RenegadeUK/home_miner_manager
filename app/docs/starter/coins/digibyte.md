# DigiByte (DGB) Mining

**Block Reward**: 277.376 DGB (current as of Jan 2026, post-halving)
**Typical Value**: £0.005-0.010 per DGB
**Block Value**: ~£1.50-£2.50 per block

## Why DGB?

- **Much easier difficulty** than Bitcoin
- **Frequent blocks**: With 10-15 TH/s, can find blocks every few weeks
- **Low regret**: Each block worth ~£2, so not devastating if electricity costs more
- **Good for medium prices**: Agile Solo Strategy uses DGB when electricity is moderate

## Network Stats

- **5 algorithms**: SHA256d (what ASICs mine), Scrypt, Skein, Qubit, Odocrypt
- **Block time**: 15 seconds per algorithm (75 seconds total per complete round)
- **Difficulty**: Much lower than Bitcoin, practical for home miners

## Mining Strategy

**When to mine DGB**:
- Electricity prices: 7-20p/kWh
- Use lower power modes (eco/low/standard)
- Expect blocks weekly/monthly depending on hashrate
- Each win is a small dopamine hit, not life-changing money

**Pool vs Solo**:
- Solo recommended: Blocks frequent enough to be rewarding
- Pool pays even less due to low coin value
- CKPool (solopool.org) is popular for DGB solo

## Income Reality

- 10 TH/s mining DGB solo: ~20-30 blocks/year = £40-60/year
- This is a hobby, not a business
- Main value: Frequent wins keep it fun, electricity waste is minimal

**Bottom Line**: DGB is the "consolation prize" coin. When BTC isn't profitable, mine DGB for frequent small wins.
